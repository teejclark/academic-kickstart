Hello! My name is T.J. Clark, and I'm a UW Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow with the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels at the University of Washington. I develop quantitative methods to conserve wildlife and biodiversity in an increasingly changing world. I am also passionate about teaching and communicating on the conservation of nature in the Anthropocene.
