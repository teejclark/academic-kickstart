Animal populations are often in flux, especially due to anthropogenic effects. However it is often difficult to survey animals to understand these changes. This is especially so in pelagic seabird populations, such as the burrow-nesting sooty shearwater Ardenna grisea, which is declining worldwide but thriving in the Falkland Islands. For my Masters, I built habitat selection models generalized using functional responses to estimate the density, occupancy, and population size of this cryptic species. I also found that sooty shearwater populations likely grew due to the cessation of historical exploitation of their native habitat, tussac grass Poa flabellata.
