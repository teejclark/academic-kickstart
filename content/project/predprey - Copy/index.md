In the Anthropocene, humans are transforming and destabilizing ecosystems, which can severely impact biodiversity. In response, humans have employed increasingly controversial management practices (e.g., assisted migration, gene drives) in an attempt to mitigate human impacts. I am interested in understanding the patterns and processes of humans' effects on wildlife and biodiversity - especially in extension to coupled human-natural systems. I am currently developing quantitative tools to help understand and more optimately manage biodiversity.
