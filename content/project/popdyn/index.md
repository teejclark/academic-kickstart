Classically, animal population dynamics are assumed to be linear, low-dimensional, and at an equilibrial stable state, and therefore modeled as such. I am building theoretical population models to understand the nature of animal population dynamics. Some lines of inquiry include: how ubiquitous are nonlinear dynamics in nature? Are populations ruled by transient or equilibrium-based dynamics? How predictable are animal population dynamics? What are the implications of these questions for management and conservation?
