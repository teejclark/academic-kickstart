The study of predator-prey population dynamics is dominated by simplified mathematical models that focus on the relationship between a single predator and prey, exemplified by the Isle Royale wolf-moose system. However, few systems are this simple in nature. Most assemblages contain multiple predator and multiple prey species, and their inclusion may spur novel and complex predator-prey interactions. I use mathematical models to represent multi-predator/prey population dynamics to understand what drives populations of large mammals and how to better manage them in the Rocky Mountain West.
