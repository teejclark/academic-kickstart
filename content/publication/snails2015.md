abstract = "Behavior can be an important determinant of invasion success. In the New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), behavior is influential in predator avoidance and probably plays a role in dispersal. The present study investigated differences in behavior among populations of different asexual clones of this species and compared introduced populations characterized by various levels of inva- siveness and New Zealand native clonal populations with respect to rheotactic, geotactic, photokinetic, and dispersal behaviors. There was a significant difference in behavior among populations in all behaviors evaluated. A population of a widespread clone (US1) behaved most differently from the other populations exhibiting differences in all behaviors including a greater propensity to disperse. These results indicate that there is a population and possibly a genotypic effect on behaviors in this freshwater snail, and this variation may help to explain why some clones are more invasive than others."
